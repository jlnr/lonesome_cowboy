Ludum Dare #22 entry by Julian Raschke <julian@raschke.de>

## Things to try this Ludum Dare

- Turn-based gameplay with animated transitions
- Animations NOT backed by a 0..1 "progress" float each
  - just plain Fixnums instead
- Pixen.app
  - super buggy, maybe shouldn't have built it from git
- Gitbox.app
  - lacks integrated diff view Ã  la Tower, unhappy
- Controller/Model separation
- Generated levels?
- Kitten? :D
